Support Vector Classifier (SVC) in Machine Learning
üìå Introduction

Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It is widely used for classification problems. The main idea is to find an optimal hyperplane that separates data points belonging to different classes with the maximum possible margin. SVC can handle both linear and non-linear classification problems using the kernel trick.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts

Hyperplane: A decision boundary that separates different classes.

Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points of each class.

Support Vectors: The critical data points closest to the hyperplane, which influence its position and orientation.

Kernels: Functions that transform data into higher dimensions to make it linearly separable. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.

üìä Workflow

Data collection and preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, scaling).

Splitting dataset into training and testing subsets.

Training the SVC model with selected kernel and hyperparameters.

Making predictions on test data.

Evaluating the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

‚úÖ Advantages

Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

Performs well even when the number of features is greater than the number of samples.

Flexible through the use of kernel functions for non-linear classification.

Robust against overfitting in high-dimensional datasets when properly regularized.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

Training can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

Performance is sensitive to the choice of kernel and hyperparameters like C and gamma.

Not very effective when there is a large amount of noise or overlapping classes.

üìå Applications

Text classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis).

Image recognition and handwriting detection.

Bioinformatics (protein classification, gene prediction).

Face and speech recognition systems.
